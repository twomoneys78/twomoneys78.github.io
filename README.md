# Dynamic Sound Generator with GPU.js and Web Audio API

This project is a web-based audio generator that creates and plays dynamically generated soundtracks using mathematical patterns, user input, and real-time synthesis. It combines GPU acceleration (via GPU.js) with the Web Audio API for efficient and high-quality audio rendering.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Sound Generation**: Generates randomized audio sequences that evolve based on user feedback.
- **Real-Time Audio Processing**: Uses GPU.js for accelerated waveform computations, supporting complex sound synthesis in real-time.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Allows users to rate songs as "good" or "bad," influencing the next iteration of sound generation.
- **Customizable Instruments**: Includes pre-defined instruments for accompaniment, sound effects, and percussion (e.g., bongos).
- **Scalable Audio Length**: Supports different playback durations, from 30 to 180 seconds.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) with JavaScript enabled.
- No external server setup is requiredâ€”just open the HTML file locally or host it on a simple HTTP server.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project ZIP file.
2. Extract the contents and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

---

## How It Works

1. **Random Initialization**: The app initializes a set of random numbers that drive the sound synthesis process.
2. **Waveform Generation**: Uses GPU.js kernels to create waveforms (`bongo`, `wave`) based on the selected instrument and user-defined parameters.
3. **Melody Playback**: Dynamically constructs melodies using a randomized scale and step patterns.
4. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - Users can rate the generated audio as "good" or "bad."
   - Ratings influence the generation of subsequent songs to refine the audio output.

---

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click the "Sound" button to generate and play a new audio track.
3. Use the "Rate this song" feature to provide feedback:
   - **Good**: Improves future tracks based on the current one.
   - **Bad**: Discards the current track and tries a new pattern.
4. Adjust playback duration using the dropdown menu labeled "Seconds."
5. Visualize waveforms in the "Upcoming Data" and "Current Data" sections.

---

## Customization

### Instruments

You can modify or add new instruments by extending the `Instrument` class in the JavaScript code. Define a unique waveform function and customize parameters like tone and volume.

### Waveform Functions

Edit the GPU.js kernels (`waveGPU`, `bongoGPU`) to implement custom waveform generation algorithms.

### Scales and Patterns

Modify the `makeScale()` and `Melody` class to experiment with different musical scales and step sequences.
